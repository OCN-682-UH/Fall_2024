# Intro
Today we are going to work with the Penguin data to learn *RMarkdown*.  

# Load libraries

```{r, warning = FALSE, message= FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(here)
```


# Inspect the data
```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

# Make a plot
```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = lm)+
  labs(x = " Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)")+
  theme_bw()
```

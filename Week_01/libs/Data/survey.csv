8/22/2024 15:31,Kassandra Jensen,Graduate Student,I am intermediate - I am pretty good at creating scripts and googling for answers,What is Github?,"use R in general, and also learn to change the colors on my graphs from the stock ones."
8/23/2024 12:47,Kauanoe Greene,Graduate Student,I am a beginner - I have used R a few times,What is Github?,Build models and create data visuals more confidently :) I am really intimidated by R-coding but see how helpful it can be for my research. I am excited to learn so much throughout this course!
8/23/2024 13:39,Solimar Carrasquillo Ho,Graduate Student,I am a beginner - I have used R a few times,I am a beginner - I know what it is and have used in a couple times,gaining confidence in coding while creating new visualizations that can apply to my data!
8/25/2024 10:51,Annie Deck,Graduate Student,I am intermediate - I am pretty good at creating scripts and googling for answers,I am a beginner - I know what it is and have used in a couple times,"I used R to do my data analysis for my masters thesis so I have some experience. However, I still feel green and would like to feel more empowered to know what kind of analyses I can run in R and how to implement them. Sometimes I felt like I was running scripts that I did not understand how they were working. Overall I think would just like to feel a lot more comfortable when using it and be more aware of what my options are in terms of figure building and statistical analysis."
8/25/2024 11:54,Savannah Damiano,Graduate Student,I have never used R in my life,What is Github?,Everything! Statistics and coding are kind of scary for me so I hope to have all the tools in my belt to feel comfortable and excited to use R.

# Start your script.  
You know what to do..... (Copy CondData.csv and DepthData.csv to your data folder)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("lubridate") # package to deal with dates and times
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# What time is it now?

Even though this may seem silly if you have a clock, it is very helpful if you want to time stamp something in your code.

```{r}
now() #what time is it now?
```

--

 You can also ask the time in other time zones.
 
```{r}
now(tzone = "EST") # what time is it on the east coast
now(tzone = "GMT") # what time in GMT
```

---
# What time is it now?

If you only want the date and not the time

```{r}
today()
```

```{r}
today(tzone = "GMT")
```

--

 You can also ask if it is morning or night right now and if it is a leap year.
 
```{r}
am(now()) # is it morning?

leap_year(now()) # is it a leap year?
```

# Date specifications for lubridate

{lubridate} does a good job of guessing the format of your date if you give just a little hint.

First, your dates **must be a character**.  

A common mistake is that you get an error trying to convert a date when it is a factor. Always check to make sure it is a character (i.e. put quotes around it).



| Date| function   |       
|----------|:-------------:|
| 2021-02-24 | ymd()|
| 02/24/2021 | mdy()|
| February 24 2021 | mdy()|
| 24/02/2021 | dmy()|


y = year  
m = month  
d = day  

---
# Date specifications for lubridate

These will all produce the same results as ISO dates 
```{r}
ymd("2021-02-24")
```

--
```{r}
mdy("02/24/2021")
```

--
```{r}
mdy("February 24 2021")
```

--
```{r}
dmy("24/02/2021")
```

# Extracting specific date or time elements from datetimes

# make a character string

# Adding dates and times

Let's say you are doing research in Mo'orea and one of your instruments is set to the correct timezone and the other one is not (not from my own experience or anything....).

Let's add 4 hours to all the datetimes

```{r}
datetimes + hours(4) # this adds 4 hours #<<

```

Notice the **s** in hour**s**

*hour()* extracts the hour component from a time and *hours()* is used to add hours to a datetime

# Adding dates and times

Let's say you are doing research in Mo'orea and one of your instruments is set to the correct timezone and the other one is not (not from my own experience or anything....).

Let's add 2 days to all the datetimes

```{r, eval=FALSE}
datetimes + hours(4) # this adds 4 hours 
```
```{r, eval=TRUE}
datetimes + days(2) # this adds 2 days #<<
```
Notice the **s** in day**s**

*day()* extracts the hour component from a time and *days()* is used to add hours to a datetime  

You can do the same with minutes(), seconds(), months(), years(), etc.

---
# Rounding dates

Round the dates to the nearest minute and nearest 5 minutes

```{r}
round_date(datetimes, "minute") # round to nearest minute #<<


round_date(datetimes, "5 mins") # round to nearest 5 minute #<<

```

You can do this with any set of times

# Challenge - share in class Tuesday

Read in the conductivity data (CondData.csv) and convert the date column to a datetime. Use the %>% to keep everything clean.

This is temperature and salinity data taken at a site with groundwater while being dragged behind a float. Data were collected every 10 seconds. You will also notice depth data.  That dataset will be used later during homework. Those data are taken from a pressure sensor, also collected data every 10 seconds.   

Hint: Always look at your data in R after you read it in. Don't trust what the excel format looks like... There may be some seconds hiding, but excel only wants to show you the minutes.  Also sometimes excel gets it right and says it's a date and other times it doesn't. Check to see if it's reading in as a character or date already or something totally different (in which case you need to make it a character in R)

# Today's totally awesome R package

Ever wanted to plot with cats? Now you can with {catterplots}!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("Gibbsdavidl/CatterPlots") # install the data 
```

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=4, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(CatterPlots)
x <-c(1:10)# make up some data
y<-c(1:10)
catplot(xs=x, ys=y, cat=3, catcolor='blue')

```

#Homework

- Read in both the conductivity and depth data.  
- Convert date columns appropriately  
- Round the conductivity data to the nearest 10 seconds so that it matches with the depth data  
- Join the two dataframes together  (in a way where there will be no NAs... i.e. join in a way where only exact matches between the two dataframes are kept)  
- take averages of date, depth, temperature, and salinity by minute 
- Make any plot using the averaged data 
- Do the entire thing using mostly pipes (i.e. you should not have a bunch of different dataframes). Keep it clean. 
- Don't forget to comment!  
- Save the output, data, and scripts appropriately

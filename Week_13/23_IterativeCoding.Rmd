# Final Project review

1. Make sure to read the instructions very carefully 
  - Note: your final project needs to be in a brand new, stand-along repository within the OCN 682 Github Organization (aka where all our repos are now) 
  
--

2. Your completed repo for your final project is due at 1pm on 12/10, regardless of when you present. NO changes will be allowed after class has started so that it is fair to everyone.  

--
3. Sign up for a presentation time [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CW4oauRyRBKb4bs_lzfC--L2SCXdEC5B3_27vmOXfx8/edit?gid=0#gid=0) 

---
# Set-up your script

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```


---
# for loops

**for loops** are one way to run an iterative process (do something over and over again). However, with the *tidyverse* you can avoid needing loops for almost any basic coding needs.  Where it does come in handy is in population modeling and Bayesian modeling, for example. Also, it is integral to programming and is happening "under the hood" whether you use them or not.



---
# for loops

For loops have two major parts: an indexing statement and a command (or set of commands) to repeat.  The coding is in base R.

The command looks like this:  
`for(index in sequence){`  
    `command to repeat}`

---
# Simple for loop

Let's ask R to print a statement telling us what year it is along a sequence of years.  

Start with the simple code for one year
```{r}
print(paste("The year is", 2000))
```

--

Put it in a for loop.

```{r}
years<-c(2015:2021)

for (i in years){ # set up the for loop where i is the index
  print(paste("The year is", i)) # loop over i
}
```

---
# Simple for loop

What we just did printed something over and over, but it did not save it anywhere.  Let's say you want to save a new vector with all the years.  To do this we need to pre-allocate space and tell R where it is going to be saved.

--
Create an empty dataframe called `year_data` with columns for `year` and `year_name` .


```{r}
#Pre-allocate space for the for loop
# empty matrix that is as long as the years vector
 year_data<-tibble(year =  rep(NA, length(years)),  # column name for year
                   year_name = rep(NA, length(years))) # column name for the year name

year_data
```
---
# Simple for loop

Add the for loop

One line at a time.  Let's first add in the column that is going to have all the names in it. Notice that I added an index `i` in the column name. I also am having the index go from 1:length(years), which is 1:7.  I use `length()` because it allows me to change the number of years in the vector without having to change the for loop. 

```{r}
for (i in 1:length(years)){ # set up the for loop where i is the index
  year_data$year_name[i]<-paste("The year is", years[i]) # loop over i #<<
}

year_data
```

---
# Simple for loop

Fill in the year column too

```{r}
for (i in 1:length(years)){ # set up the for loop where i is the index
  year_data$year_name[i]<-paste("The year is", years[i]) # loop over year name
  year_data$year[i]<-years[i] # loop over year #<<
}

year_data
```
---
# Using loops to read in multiple .csv files

Let's say you have multiple data files where you want to perform the same action to each. You can use a for loop to do this. 

In the data folder you will see a subfolder called *cond_data*.  Here I have 3 files of salinity and temperature data collected from Mo'orea from a spatial survey.

Read in one of the files so that you can see what it looks like.

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
testdata<-read_csv(here("Week_13", "data", "cond_data","011521_CT316_1pcal.csv"))

glimpse(testdata)
```

---
# list files in a directory

```{r}
# point to the location on the computer of the folder
CondPath<-here("Week_13", "data", "cond_data")

# list all the files in that path with a specific pattern
# In this case we are looking for everything that has a .csv in the filename

# you can use regex to be more specific if you are looking for certain patterns in filenames
files <- dir(path = CondPath,pattern = ".csv")

files

```
---
# pre-allocate space for the loop
Let's calculate the mean temperature and salinity from each file and save it

```{r}
# pre-allocate space
# make an empty dataframe that has one row for each file and 3 columns
 cond_data<-tibble(filename =  rep(NA, length(files)),  # column name for year
                   mean_temp = rep(NA, length(files)), # column name for the mean temperature
                   mean_sal = rep(NA, length(files)), # column name for the mean salinity
                   ) # column name for the year name


cond_data
```



---
# for loop

write basic code to calculate a mean and build out
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
raw_data<-read_csv(paste0(CondPath,"/",files[1])) # test by reading in the first file and see if it works
head(raw_data)
mean_temp<-mean(raw_data$Temperature, na.rm = TRUE) # calculate a mean
mean_temp
```
---
# Turn it into a for loop

```{r, eval = FALSE}
for (i in 1:length(files)){ # loop over 1:3 the number of files #<<
  
  
} 

```

--

# Add in the loop over the raw data

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
for (i in 1:length(files)){ # loop over 1:3 the number of files 

raw_data<-read_csv(paste0(CondPath,"/",files[i])) #<<
glimpse(raw_data)#<<

} 

```

---
# Add in the columns

First, add in the filename for each row
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
for (i in 1:length(files)){ # loop over 1:3 the number of files 

raw_data<-read_csv(paste0(CondPath,"/",files[i]))
#glimpse(raw_data)#<<

cond_data$filename[i]<-files[i]#<<
  
} 

cond_data
```
---
# Add in means

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
for (i in 1:length(files)){ # loop over 1:3 the number of files 

raw_data<-read_csv(paste0(CondPath,"/",files[i]))
#glimpse(raw_data)

cond_data$filename[i]<-files[i]
cond_data$mean_temp[i]<-mean(raw_data$Temperature, na.rm =TRUE)#<<
cond_data$mean_sal[i]<-mean(raw_data$Salinity, na.rm =TRUE)#<< 
} 

cond_data
```

# {purrr}

[purrr cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/purrr.pdf)

Now, I will teach you to do the exact same thing, but with tidyverse style language.

*"purrr enhances R’s functional programming (FP) toolkit by providing a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors. If you’ve never heard of FP before, the best place to start is the family of map() functions which allow you to replace many for loops with code that is both more succinct and easier to read. The best place to learn about the map() functions is the [iteration chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html) in R for data science."*

# map functions

The pattern of looping over a vector, doing something to each element and saving the results is so common that the purrr package provides a family of functions to do it for you. There is one function for each type of output:

- `map()` makes a list.
- `map_lgl()` makes a logical vector.
- `map_int()` makes an integer vector.
- `map_dbl()` makes a double vector.
- `map_chr()` makes a character vector.
- `map_df()` makes a dataframe

Each function takes a vector as input, applies a function to each piece, and then returns a new vector that’s the same length (and has the same names) as the input.

# Simple example

There 3 ways to do the same thing in a map() function

--

**Use a canned function that already exists**

Let's calculate the mean from a set of random numbers and do it 10 times

Create a vector from 1:10
```{r, eval = FALSE}
1:10 # a vector from 1 to 10 (we are going to do this 10 times) #<<
```

--
for each time 1:10 make a vector of 15 random numbers based on a normal distribution
```{r}
1:10 %>% # a vector from 1 to 10 (we are going to do this 10 times) %>% # the vector to iterate over
  map(rnorm, n = 15) # calculate 15 random numbers based on a normal distribution in a list #<<

```

---
# Simple example

Calculate the mean from each list
```{r}
1:10 %>% # a vector from 1 to 10 (we are going to do this 10 times) %>% # the vector to iterate over
  map(rnorm, n = 15)  %>% # calculate 15 random numbers based on a normal distribution in a list 
  map_dbl(mean) # calculate the mean. It is now a vector which is type "double" #<<

```

---
# Same thing different notation...

**Make your own function**

```{r}
1:10 %>% # list 1:10
  map(function(x) rnorm(15, x)) %>% # make your own function
  map_dbl(mean)
```

--

**Use a formula when you want to change the arguments within the function**

```{r}
1:10 %>%
  map(~ rnorm(15, .x)) %>% # changes the arguments inside the function
  map_dbl(mean)
```


---
# Bring in files using purrr instead of a for loop

Reminder: find the files
```{r}
# point to the location on the computer of the folder
CondPath<-here("Week_13", "data", "cond_data")
files <- dir(path = CondPath,pattern = ".csv")

files

```

--
Or, we can get the full file names in one less step by doing this...

```{r}
files <- dir(path = CondPath,pattern = ".csv", full.names = TRUE)
#save the entire path name
files
```

---
# read in the files

Next, read in the files using map instead of a for loop while retaining the filename as a column. 


```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
data<-files %>%
  set_names()%>% # set's the id of each list to the file name
  map_df(read_csv,.id = "filename") # map everything to a dataframe and put the id in a column called filename

data
```

---
# calculate means

Now we have a regular dataframe and we can calculate means in the way we already know how! group_by filename and use summarize

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
data<-files %>%
  set_names()%>% # set's the id of each list to the file name
  map_df(read_csv,.id = "filename") %>% # map everything to a dataframe and put the id in a column called filename
  group_by(filename) %>% #<<
  summarise(mean_temp = mean(Temperature, na.rm = TRUE), #<<
            mean_sal = mean(Salinity,na.rm = TRUE)) #<<

data
```

---
# Other uses
 
Maps and loops are awesome for more complicated processes too. For example, you could plot something and save it automatically from each file using similar code.

Read these chapters in [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html) and [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functionals.html) to see all the fancy shortcuts you can do with the purrr package

# Homework

You have a set of 4 .csv files in data/homework. Each of these files is a timeseries of temperature and light data collected in tide pools in Oregon by Jenn Fields. Your goal is to bring in all 4 files and calculate the mean and standard deviation of both temperature (Temp.C) and light (Intensity.lux) for each tide pool.  Use **both** a for loop and map() functions in your script. (Basically, do it twice). Due Tuesday at 1pm. 

.center[**Data Dictionary**]

|Variable Name | Description|
|:----------:|:------------|
|PoolID| ID of the pool|
|Foundation_spp| Surfgrass or mussel dominated pool|
|Removal_Control| Was it a removal or control treatment|
|Date.Time| Date and time|
|Temp.C| Temperature in degrees C|
|Intensity.lux| Light level in lux|
|LoggerDepth| Depth of the logger in meters|

# Class Evaluations

Please take 10 minutes to do this now.
[Link Here](https://www.hawaii.edu/ces/)
- These class evals are really important to both me and the department.

### I uploaded the lecture on intro modeling as an online class so that you have it available to you before your independent project is due  
- There is no homework associated with it, but it will be on your quiz and it is super useful to prep you for statistics
